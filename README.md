## 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

Began with starter code, to create a book search application to allow users to log in, find books, create and save a book list, remove books from list. Application uses the RESTful API, Google Books API and was refactored to to GraphQL API with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Sadly, this application still throws up errors when trying to Sign Up and therefore does not run properly. And unfortunately time has run out to complete. Application was deployed with heroku.
